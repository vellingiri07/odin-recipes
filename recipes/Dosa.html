        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Dosa is the ever-popular South Indian breakfast of crispy crepes made with ground rice and lentil batter that is fermented. With just a handful of 
          ingredients learn to make the classic Dosa recipe from scratch with my easy video and step-by-step photos.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Rice</li>
             <li>Vigna Mungo</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and soak rice (regular and parboiled) in water for 4-5 hours. Separately, rinse and soak urad dal, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds in water 
            for the same duration.</li>
            <li>Drain the soaked urad dal mixture, reserving the water, and grind it until smooth and fluffy using the reserved water.</li> 
            <li>Drain the soaked rice and grind it in batches to a smooth yet slightly grainy texture, using less water than for the dal.
            </li>
            <li>Mix the ground rice and dal batters in a large container, add salt, and stir well. Cover and ferment the batter overnight or for 8-10 hours at room 
            temperature until it rises and bubbles.</li>
            <li>Heat a tawa or skillet on medium flame and grease it lightly with oil.</li>
            <li>Pour a ladle of batter onto the tawa, spread it in a spiral motion into a thin round, and drizzle oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until golden                brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the dosa and repeat the process with the remaining batter. Serve hot with chutney or sambar.</li>
        </ol>
